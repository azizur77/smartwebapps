The fund warned the Germans in recent weeks that it would withhold urgently needed funds and trigger a Greek sovereign default unless Berlin stopped delaying and pledged firmly that it would come to Greece's rescue.Senior officials and diplomats in Brussels confirmed that the IMF threat to pull the plug on its funding, in stark contrast to the more emollient line of Strauss-Kahn, had been defused because of a German climbdown.As political turmoil continued in Greece on Thursday, with the prime minister, George Papandreou, scrambling to form a fresh government, the stage was being set for a political struggle between Europe's powerbrokers over the fine print of the proposed new \u20ac100bn-plus rescue of Greece.Berlin is deeply at odds with France and with the key EU institutions \u2013 the European Central Bank (ECB), the European commission, the presidency of the EU, and the head of the eurozone, Jean-Claude Juncker, prime minister of Luxembourg \u2013 over the terms of a deal.While conceding the need for the fresh bailout, Berlin is insisting that the banks and other private creditors holding Greek debt take losses as part of the rescue plan, which is expected to amount to \u20ac125bn (\u00a3110bn), or about \u20ac90bn if the Germans succeed in forcing losses on holders of Greek bonds.Although international stock markets enjoyed a calmer day on Thursday, Juncker believes that imposing losses on investors could trigger a European version of the Lehman Brothers bank collapse \u2013 a so-called \"credit event\". Juncker said: \"It's a really ugly situation. The [German] idea is dangerous. It could provoke the gravest risk, that all three rating agencies declare a credit event and then there are big contagion risks for other countries.\"Nout Wellink, a member of the ECB's governing council, warned that the EU bailout fund would have to double to \u20ac1.5tn if Greece does fail to pay its debts and spreads financial turmoil to other countries. French president Nicolas Sarkozy goes to Berlin on Friday for a summit with German chancellor Angela Merkel, with the aim of stitching up a compromise.Under Greece's first \u20ac110bn bailout, shared by the EU and the IMF, a fifth tranche of \u20ac12bn is to be disbursed next month. Publicly, the IMF had been threatening to withhold its share of the money unless Greece's funding gap for 2012 is closed. But Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs, said on Thursday that the EU and the IMF had agreed to throw Greece the \u20ac12bn lifeline by next month to forestall a default.Privately, sources said that Lipsky challenged the Germans on the fringes of a G8 summit in France almost three weeks ago, and demanded that Berlin guarantee Greece's borrowing requirements and put a figure on the pledge. The IMF ultimatum came a week after Strauss-Kahn, a former French presidential contender, resigned as IMF chief following his New York arrest on charges he denies of attempted rape and sexual assault of a hotel chambermaid.Berlin blinked, according to participants in the negotiations, and 10 days after the IMF challenge, the Merkel government admitted for the first time that Greece would need a new bailout. But it stoked further controversy by demanding that Greece's private creditors take losses on their loans.Before a series of crucial EU meetings starting this weekend, Berlin looks increasingly isolated in its demands, spelling trouble for Merkel at home, where the rescue of spendthrift eurozone countries is deeply unpopular. Merkel's junior coalition partner, the liberal Free Democrats, on Thursday reiterated the need for the banks to take some of the pain in the Greek crisis.The rescue scenario is also hostage to developments in Greece, with European leaders anxiously eyeing the political turmoil in Athens and questioning  whether Papandreou would be able to deliver on his side of the bargain: savage spending cuts and tax increases aimed at raising \u20ac28bn, combined with a \u20ac50bn privatisation programme.\"We expect the Greek parliament to endorse the economic reform programme as agreed by the end of June,\" said Rehn. \"We will not let the euro area face any kind of catastrophe.\"The turmoil sent the euro tumbling to a record low versus the safe-haven Swiss franc, and intensified pressure on the region's other lower-rated states, highlighted by weakening demand at a Spanish bond auction.Senior officials in Brussels worried that time was running out. Papandreou's attempt to form a government, win a vote of confidence and then drive the austerity package through parliament could take longer than scheduled, jeopardising the planning in European capitals.European debt crisisIMFEuropeGreeceGermanyIan Traynorguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/16/imf-forced-germany-to-guarantee-greek-bailout", "title": "IMF made Germany guarantee Greek bailout", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 00:56:10"}}, {"pk": 388, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "US president rejects suggestion from John Boehner that formal approval of Congress was needed before taking military actionBarack Obama has vigorously defended his right to take military action in Libya without the formal approval of Congress, after Republican leaders challenged his authority amid the right's growing suspicion of costly foreign military operations.This week the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, wrote to Obama telling him that, under the 1973 war powers act, the president was obliged to seek congressional approval for the Libyan venture before Friday.The White House replied by saying the law, which says there must be a vote in the legislature within 90 days of the president taking the US to war, did not apply because US participation in the Nato bombing did not amount to full-blown war.The issue unites liberals opposed to foreign ventures with fiscal conservatives, including some Tea Party supporters who want big cuts in military spending, although other Republicans want defence protected from budgetary restraints.  The dispute is unlikely to have an immediate effect on the US role in Libya, but is becoming a sharp issue as next year's presidential election draws near, with some members of Congress filing a lawsuit accusing Obama of breaking the law.Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, said she was deeply concerned by reports of wide-scale rape in Libya and other acts of sexual violence across the Arab region. She praised the \"brave women\" of Libya who came forward to tell of brutality at the hands of Gaddafi's forces. She urged a thorough investigation and the perpetrators to be brought to justice.Boehner, the speaker of the House, added to that pressure earlier this week when he wrote to the president to tell him that refusing to comply with a congressional request to seek authorisation for military action in Libya appeared to violate the war powers act.\"The combination of [White House] actions has left many members of Congress, as well as the American people, frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration's strategic policies, by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress, and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution,\" Boehner said in the letter.The White House has responded with a 38-page report to members of Congress, describing the Libya operation not as war, but a mission to remove Muammar Gaddafi from power.The administration says that since Nato took over command of the operation in April, the US role has largely been restricted to supporting military action by Britain, France and others with refuelling and surveillance missions. But it acknowledges that remote control drones, as deployed in Pakistan and Yemen, are also at times used to fire missiles.\"US operations do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor do they involve US ground troops,\" the report said.Boehner dismissed the White House position on Thursday. \"It doesn't pass the straight-face test in my view that we're not in the midst of hostilities,\" he said. \"It's been four weeks since the president has talked to the American people about this mission. It's time for the president to outline for the American people why we are there, what the mission is, and what our goals are.\"The House speaker said that Republican leaders were considering their options including \"the power of the purse\".A major concern for the Republicans is the cost, after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the US's ballooning deficit. The White House report says the assault on Libya will have cost the US $1.1bn by the time the latest phase of the Nato operation ends in September. Some more liberal members of Congress say the US has no business intervening in foreign conflicts.On Wednesday, 10 members of Congress from both parties asked the courts to order Obama to withdraw American forces from the Libya operation. The author of the lawsuit, Dennis Kucinich, said the White House's arguments about the degree of involvement did not stand up to scrutiny. \"Look, we're at war. There's already been $750m spent,\" he said. \"Whether there are boots on the ground or not doesn't really get into the question of whether or not the president had the ability [to intervene] in the first place. It's a constitutional issue here, and it can't be danced around at all.\"Another member of Congress, California Democrat Lynn Woolsey, accused the administration of showing \"contempt for the constitution\".The war powers act was passed in 1973 amid a backlash against abuse of presidential authority during the Vietnam war \u2013 including the secret and illegal bombing of Cambodia \u2013 and over the veto of President Richard Nixon.It requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending the military in to action. If those forces are to remain in action for more than 90 days, the legislation requires that the president seek the approval of Congress.It has been ignored by several presidents, and some administrations have questioned its constitutionality. However, the Obama White House said that it recognises that the law is legal but argues that it does not apply.Barack ObamaObama administrationUS CongressLibyaJohn BoehnerUnited StatesUS politicsNatoMiddle EastAfricaChris McGrealguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/16/barack-obama-libya-congress", "title": "Obama: no legal breach over Libya", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 00:58:45"}}, {"pk": 389, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "New York congressman finally steps down as US Democrats try to limit impact 'Weinergate' has on 2012 presidential raceTwenty days after the scandal dubbed \"Weinergate\" erupted with the sending of a sexually suggestive photograph on Twitter, a rising star of the Democrats was forced to resign his congressional seat in the face of pressure from the highest levels of his party.In a brief statement delivered at the same elder person's centre in Brooklyn where he launched his first electoral campaign 20 years ago, Anthony Weiner repeated his apologies to his wife and constituents for the \"personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment I have caused\". He said that the \"distraction I have created\" made it impossible to continue.As he announced his resignation, a heckler at the back of the hall shouted: \"Bye bye pervert!\"From having been ranked as a possible future Democratic leader and the frontrunner to become New York mayor in 2013, Weiner's fall from grace is spectacular and close to complete. He has spent his entire adult life in politics, having been elected in 1991 as the youngest councillor to serve in New York city at the age of 27.True to his character as an abrasive and at times antagonistic politician, Weiner, now 46, at first tried to lie his way out of the sex scandal he provoked by sending lewd photographs of himself to several different women.When the rightwing blogger Andrew Breitbart revealed his actions on 28 May, Weiner initially claimed his Twitter account had been hacked into. He later changed his story to say he wasn't sure whether the images of a semi-naked man were of him.After further revelations emerged virtually every day of his sexually charged interactions, he went in front of the cameras on 6 June to admit that he had been involved with at least six different women in cyberspace. But even then he refused to stand down from his New York seat.The fallout from the scandal rose to the top of the Democratic party. On Monday, President Obama said that \"if it was me, I would resign\".Bill Clinton has also taken a direct role in pushing Weiner. The former president has reportedly been \"livid\" about Weiner's behaviour, despite Clinton's own history of sexual peccadilloes.The Clintons are intricately linked with Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin. Bill Clinton officiated at their wedding. Also, Abedin is a close aide to the secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and her best friend Doug Band is Bill Clinton's top adviser.\"The decision for Weiner to go was taken on a presidential level, by the existing and a past president,\" said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who has worked on campaigns for Bill Clinton. \"It was a straight political decision.\"The views of Abedin, who is pregnant with their first child, were also likely to have been crucial. She returned on Wednesday from a trip to the Middle East with Clinton and was in discussions with her husband before his announcement.The official line taken by party leaders such as Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chief in the House of Representatives who called on him to resign, was that the scandal was distracting attention from important political debates such as the economy.The imbroglio has fallen at a sensitive time in which the party's coffers for next year's presidential race are being filled. Key fundraisers have complained that donors were being turned off by the salacious revelations.Weiner might have found it easier to weather the storm if he had more friends within the party. But his outspoken and irascible style earned him few protectors within Congress or the White House.Despite the almost universal pressure on him to go, there remain those in the party who lamented Weiner's passing as a prominent liberal politician who was prepared to speak out on core left-wing principles. \"He was a firebrand, an independent voice. Yes, he was a little quirky and he had an ego, but at least on the issues that liberals care about he was upfront,\" said Democratic strategist Victor Kamber.Weiner now faces a bleak future. With no training in law and without the media behind him, there is nowhere obvious for him to go, unlike Eliot Spitzer, the disgraced former New York governor who is now a CNN presenter.Sheinkopf predicted it would be at least 10 years, \"if ever\", before Weiner could contemplate a comeback in politics.Weiner himself said that he would now be looking for ways outside politics \"to contribute my talents\", adding that \"with God's help and hard work, we will all be successful\".Anthony WeinerUS politicsDemocratsUnited StatesBarack ObamaBill ClintonNew YorkEd Pilkingtonguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/16/anthony-weiner-resigns-twitter-scandal", "title": "Weiner resigns over Twitter photo scandal", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 11:26:01"}}, {"pk": 390, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Joaquin Almunia said the guarantee had limited the capacity of the state to force bondholders to absorb some of the losses, 'so the losses one way or another have ended in the public sector'The timing could have been better, coming just days after the former finance minister Brian Lenihan was buried. But history has no time for sentiment and it is now on the record that Europe thinks the controversial blanket bank guarantee issued on 29 September 2008 was a \"mistake\".The unlimited guarantee has meant that taxpayers already suffering austerity measures to cover a budget deficit also remain on the hook for bank debts.Lenihan had acted on partial and misleading information from the banks and had been put in an impossible position as tried to prevent a catastrophic bank run the next day.But remarks by Joaquin Almunia, the then EU economics commissioner in an interview with the Irish Times today begs the question: if the bank guarantee was a mistake, isn't Europe's implacable opposition to burning bondholders also a mistake? Surely that is the only conclusion one can draw?When asked whether Lenihan's decision was a mistake, Almunia said: \"Yes, indeed.\"Almunia, who is now the European competition commissioner, said the decision was presented to Brussels as a fait accompli.He said the then government's failure to notify Europe was \"very unfortunate\" and that the initiative had come as a surprise. \"To my knowledge everything was explained and discussed ex poste ... If I remember well, it was at the end of the September 2008 when the Irish authorities \u2013 without notification here [in Brussels] \u2013 extended an unlimited guarantee to assets, also to creditors; and all those bondholders than can benefit from this unlimited guarantee, they are protected. \"This was not our decision ... We were dealing the day after with how do you say \u2013 a fait accompli,\" Almunia said.He said the guarantee had limited the capacity of the state to force bondholders to absorb some of the losses, \"so the losses one way or another have ended in the public sector\".The Irish are only too familiar with the consequences of the blanket guarantee  \u2013 the public are now on the hook for tens of billions of bank debt and facing taxes and cuts to cover the bailout that flowed from the sovereign debt crisis that followed.And besides, the European commission's view on the bank guarantee was quite different a year ago. Back in June 2010 \u2013 only one year ago - the commission decided to extend the bank guarantee and was fully in favour of it.\"The scheme was an appropriate measure of remedying a serious disturbance in the Irish economy,\" the commission said at the time.One can only hope for Ireland's sake, that the new finance minister Michael Noonan is afforded the same type of revisionism when he officially goes to Europe with his proposal to burn senior bondholders at Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide Building Society.IrelandEuropeEuropean commissionIreland bailoutLisa O'Carrollguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jun/17/brian-lenihan-bank-guarantee-joaquin-almunia", "title": "European commissioner says Lenihan bank guarantee was mistake", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 12:15:54"}}, {"pk": 391, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Angela Merkel admits defeat in struggle to extract money from private sector towards European Union rescue packageAngela Merkel has admitted defeat over Germany's plan to force private banks to contribute funds to a new bailout package designed to rescue the Greek economy.After a meeting with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in Berlin on Thursday, the German chancellor said they had agreed that any contribution from private creditors to the package would have to be voluntary.\"We want the participation of private creditors on a voluntary basis,\" said Merkel, stressing that there was no legal way in which banks could be forced to play along.She and Sarkozy both declined to set a date for the Greek deal to be finalised. But Sarkozy indicated that time was running out. \"We want a quick fix ... There is no time to waste,\" said Sarkozy.The summit was well received by financial markets, which have fallen sharply in recent days as investors feared that Greece would suffer a disorderly default.In London, the FTSE 100 index erased early losses, and the euro strengthened against other major currencies. Greek government bonds also staged a small recovery. The yield, or interest rate, on the two-year Greek bond dropped to 28.6%, from over 30% early on Friday.Merkel's admission was a significant climbdown from her earlier position. Berlin had lobbied noisily for the compulsory participation in a new Greek bailout of private lenders, many of whom stand to lose heavily if Greece defaults on its \u20ac300bn (\u00a3265bn) debts.Last year's first Greek bailout, part-funded by European taxpayers, was hugely unpopular in Germany, and Merkel was keen to send a message to voters that not just they, but also the banks, would be paying this time around.Earlier this month, European Union finance ministers were said to be considering a plan in which private creditors possessing Greek state bonds would be asked to cover \u20ac20bn \u2013 \u20ac35bn of the costs .As Europe's paymaster, Germany had called for Greece's private creditors to swap their bonds for new ones with maturities that are seven years longer, but encountered fierce resistance to those plans from France, the European central bank and European commission. France in particular was adamant that trying to force private creditors into any Greek deal would be dangerous for the markets.On Thursday, the head of the eurozone, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that imposing losses on investors could trigger a European version of the Lehman Brothers bank collapse \u2013 a so-called \"credit event\". \"It's a really ugly situation. The [German] idea is dangerous. It could provoke the gravest risk, that all three rating agencies declare a credit event and then there are big contagion risks for other countries,\" he said .Merkel's meeting with Sarkozy on Friday morning in Berlin was the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders in seven very rocky months in Franco-German relations. On Wednesday, the French ambassador to Germany, Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, told a select group of German journalists that Berlin pays too little attention to its ties with Paris.The ambassador suggested Merkel did not give Sarkozky enough face time, pointing out that the last chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, agreed to more one-on-one meetings with his French counterpart when he was in power .But at Thursday's press conference at the chancellery, Sarkozy heralded a \"major breakthrough\" with \"our German friends\". In three hours of talks, he and Merkel had at least agreed that there ideally should be some involvement on the private sector in the Greece bailout, he said.The deal was based on four principles: voluntary participation, speed, no payment default and agreement with the European central bank. Both leaders also stressed that Greece had to comply with its obligations.The duo were keen to reach a consensus ahead of next week's EU summit in Brussels, which will see European leaders try to hammer out a Greek deal.GreeceEuroCurrenciesEuroEuropean UnionEconomicsGermanyFranceAngela MerkelNicolas SarkozyHelen Piddguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/greece-bailout-germany-private-banks", "title": "Germany climbs down over Greece bailout demands", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 12:08:37"}}, {"pk": 392, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Ash from the Chilean volcano chain Puyehue-Cordon Caulle has devastated parts of Argentina\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2011/jun/17/argentinian-ash-chilean-volcano-video", "title": "Argentinian villages covered in ash from Chilean volcano - video", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 12:04:24"}}, {"pk": 393, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Fake bomb was found on UPS flight in March while printer cartridge bomb was discovered on one of firm's planes in 2010The Department for Transport has barred the delivery firm UPS from moving air cargo through sites in the UK due to \"security requirements\".A spokeswoman would not reveal which sites had been restricted and why the move had been taken.

Democrats can only lose by backing hypocritical moralismHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi and President Barack Obama have succeeded. They have made Queens Congressman's Anthony Weiner's lewd Twitter messages grounds for his resigning his seat in the House of Representatives. The two most powerful Democrats in the country have cut the last vestige of support from Weiner, the most outspoken foe of the current Republican assault on Medicare and Medicaid. But in the midst of this fiasco, it is important for us to put Weiner's sexual misdeeds in historical perspective. He doesn't rank very high on the American sex scandal parade. Presidents Thomas Jefferson (Sally Hemings), Franklin Roosevelt (Lucy Mercer) and John Kennedy (Judith Exner) all had sexual relationships that, by the standards being applied to Anthony Weiner, should have ended their political careers.The facts surrounding these affairs are especially tawdry. Sally Hemings was a slave and just 16 years old when she first became pregnant as a result of her liaison with Jefferson. Lucy Mercer was Eleanor Roosevelt's social secretary when her affair with Franklin Roosevelt began. That relationship was a personal and professional betrayal of her boss. Jackie Kennedy was pregnant with her second chilfd and on a trip to Florida when John Kennedy, then a senator, brought Judith Exner to the Kennedy's Georgetown home for a night of sex in 1960.These are not the kinds of deeds presidents want to be remembered for, but historians as serious as Annette Gordon-Reed, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Seymour Hersh have made them part of thoughtful presidential biographies that raise a serious \"what if\" question: does anyone think we would be better off if Jefferson, Roosevelt and Kennedy had not been elected president or been obliged to resign because of their sexual failings?As for Weiner's lewd photo liaisons, inexcusable as they are, they don't begin to match the sexual scandals surrounding many of his political contemporaries. Just compare him to the following politicians \u2013 all of whom are thriving these days and were never forced to leave office. Anthony Weiner did not:\u2022 in the Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia tradition, offer the feeble excuse of overwork to explain his sexual misconduct.\u2022 in the Senator David Vitter of Louisiana tradition, hypocritically claim he was a family values man, then wind up in the records of the DC \"madam\".\u2022 in the President Bill Clinton tradition, allow himself to become involved with a subordinate with whom he had oral sex and then try to deny it.\u2022 in the Representative Barney Franks of Massachusetts tradition, hire a prostitute and later use his congressional office to get the man's parking tickets cancelled.These comparisons should cheer nobody, but they do put Anthony's Weiner sexual misconduct and our new \"age of puritanism\" in perspective.

The results are rarely dull.Borrowing from ideas pioneered in New York and Hong Kong, secret dinner clubs are now the menu du jour, some with themes betraying Singapore's inherently geeky nature.Co-founded by expats Florian Cornu, 26, and Denisa Kera, 36, the Secret Cooks Club themes its dinners on novel concepts in the areas of technology, philosophy and food science. A recent five-course meal called You Are What You Eat, But You Can Also Eat What You Are required every dinner guest to send in saliva samples, from which meals were created based on their DNA.Another dinner pushed conservative cultural boundaries by copying the Japanese practice of nyotaimori \u2013 serving sushi on a naked woman's body.The two self-declared nerds, who met at Singapore's underground Hackerspace club, wanted to add an \"element of excitement to a city full of potential, but a bit sleepy and dull\", Kera said.Similarly interested in rebelling against what she felt was a lack of \"personality, history or unique ambiance\" in Singapore's restaurants, Zina Alam, 27, decided to start her own Bangladeshi-style supper club called Khana Commune.\"Singapore is changing every day, politically and culturally,\" said the former journalist, whose own change of direction was inspired by a visit to Edinburgh's supper clubs. \"People are a lot more open and adventurous now.\"Even larger establishments are catching on. At Kilo, a new Japanese-Italian fusion venture in a converted waterfront warehouse, diners are encouraged to step away from the table and into the kitchen, where, from August, they will be able to guest chef for an evening. The aim is to prepare a meal of up to five courses fthat diners will \"love, hate, scrutinise \u2013 and everything else in between\", said Kilo's 32-year-old co-founder, Sharon Lee.New ideas are also emerging beyond the dinner plate. At Blink-BL-NK, a monthly ideas-exchanging night, ordinary people share their expertise about subjects of their choice in open forums along the lines of TED events. Recent talks focussed on pilgrimages, psychosis and sex \u2013 the latter two traditionally taboo subjects in a \"rational, efficiency-orientated society\", according to regular attendee Stella Lee, 28. \"You wouldn't see this anywhere else in Singapore.\"\"This city is growing up,\" said 32-year-old Isaac Souweine, co-founder of Blink-BL-NK. \"A hundred years ago this place was a swamp. The economic development here happened really fast.

Drums, keyboards, guitars and microphones are all provided.\"It's a great way to get the crowd involved,\" said manager Anita Lydia. \"Most people think Sundays are quiet, but budding artists too afraid to play in a bigger arena, or even well-known bands like Deep Purple, have all come to jam.\"The beauty of living in a \"cultural desert\", some say, is that it provides an empty space upon which a promising new future, like Singapore's, can be built. \"We are definitely at the cusp of finding a real national identity,\"  Alam said.SingaporeSingaporeAsiaguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/singapore-culture-dinner-clubs-music", "title": "Singapore finds its cultural feet with culinary renaissance", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 11:54:51"}}, {"pk": 397, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Zainab al-Khawaja allowed to spend 10 minutes with her husband Wafu Almajed, who was arrested in AprilThe young Bahraini woman who become a prominent face of the Arab uprisings after going on hunger strike to protest at the detention of relatives has described in a series of heart-rending tweets her first meeting with her husband in more than two months.Zainab al-Khawaja, who staged a 10-day fast in April following the beating and arrest of her father, a prominent human rights activist, and the arrest of her husband and her brother-in-law, described being allowed to spend just six minutes with Wafu Almajed.Much of Khawaja's overseas profile comes from her much-read and prolific updates under the Twitter moniker angryarabiya. Friday's brief reunion, in which Khawaja was allowed to bring along the couple's 20-month-old daughter, Jude, was described immediately afterwards in a series of breathless and emotional 140-character missives. Beginning, \"Hi every1, at long last, finally, I have seen my husband,\" Khawaja described being let into the jail in Manama, Bahrain's capital, by one of the police officers who arrested and beat up her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. He also remains in custody.The description continued: \"They took us to a room, after searching us. Then Wafi walked in. I dunno how to explain how I felt ...

Jude had just woken up and was staring at Wafi, probably surprised. Then wafi sang 'if all the raindrops' another of Judes favorites.\"In tweets before the visit Khawaja had speculated that the 70-day wait before she was allowed to see her husband could be to allow the physical signs of any mistreatment to fade. After visiting him she described seeing what appeared to be a series of old bruises around his face. Her husband did not ask about Khawaja's father, she added, speculating that this could be because he had been ordered not to do so by police.She ended the description of the visit: \"Then he kept saying 'jude has grown, she's so much bigger. Does she talk? Wat can she say?' ... he asked abt family, asked me why I had lost so much weight. Asked if I was ok ... The whole meeting was abt 6 minutes. The police said 'visit is over' ... We hugged, he told me to take good care of jude, I told him to stay strong and pray.

The collapse of Borders UK operations at the end of 2009 resulted in one off costs of around \u00a310m, as 36 coffee bars that were located in its book shops were forced to close.But UK like-for-like sales rose by 5% in the year to 3 October 2010, as customers responded to a new loyalty card and products such as \"Doubleshot\" chilled coffees. Total sales increased 2% to \u00a3396m, according to the accounts filed at Companies House.UK managing director Darcy Willson-Rymer said: \"Our sales are still growing despite tough conditions on the high street and our financial position continues to improve.\" He added that customers were responding to the \"changes we're making\" which included introducing a more British menu which includes bacon butties and porridge as well as the usual muffins.The US company's fortunes have recovered under founder Howard Schultz who returned to lead the New York listed company three years ago, when it was cut adrift by the collapse in consumer spending during the banking crisis.Grocery salesOne of the problems identified by Schultz on his return was the \"commoditisation\" of the brand, which in the past has been a target for anti-globalisation campaigners. He put the brakes on aggressive expansion and closed nearly 1,000 problem stores, mainly in the US. It is also targeting grocery sales, with its instant coffee brand Via and bottled Frappucino now sold in supermarkets.When Starbucks arrived in the UK in the late 1990s it fired up the country's nascent coffee culture but it now faces stiff competition in what has become the world's third-largest market for branded espresso bars after the US and Canada. Costa Coffee has overtaken it to become the market leader with 1,100 branches to date and recently announced plans for many more.As part of Schultz's plan to continue the rejuvenation, it has embarked on a major rebranding exercise that has seen the familiar chunky white mugs disappear from its coffee bars and replaced with more sophisticated bone china cups. In addition the American company has also dropped its name from its well-known siren logo.The UK chain spent \u00a324m renovating 100 stores during the year and also opened its first motorway outlets. It also experimenting with new store types with a dozen \"drive-thrus\" due to open this year and another 20 flagships to be revamped before the London Olympics.Willson-Rymer said the positive sales trend had continued in the new financial year and it expected to open new stores \"at a measured pace\" which was expected \"to lead to further improvements in the financial performance of the business.

A meditation? A stupafaction? A dharmagation? Whatever, it was a rare gathering at Admiralty House on Whitehall this week where the leaders of the religion's various bodies in this country were brought together at the invitation of Sayeeda Warsi at a reception to celebrate the contribution of the Buddhist community to the UK.One can view a room of Buddhist monks rather like an tube map \u2013 it's all about the colours. So here were the dark browns of the Zen robes, the decorative reds and golds of the Tibetan tradition and the various shades of orange and saffron of the Theravadan schools. Here also were Burmese monks in their crimson robes, so familiar from the protests of 2007, as well as Zen priests from the Pure Land school, whose decorated brown robes looked faintly high church. Dotted among them, too, were two white-costumed Jain nuns and one brave, lone Zoroastrian.This was always going to be a somewhat eccentric event, and so it proved \u2013 from the sight of monks producing mobiles from their robes to hand in at reception, to the choir of the London Buddhist Vihara in Chiswick who sang a happy-clappy song that sounded like a Sanskrit version of \"I've got a never-ending love for you\". And all of this taking place in grand, 18th-century rooms, beneath chandeliers and surrounded by enormous, gilt-framed naval paintings.The final touch was the presence of so many members of the armed forces, all dressed to the nines, medals marching across their breasts, who gave the event a slightly Jewel in the Crown feel. Apparently, they were all members of the Armed Forces' Buddhist Society. Admit it, you didn't know it existed.Climbing onto one of the sofas (ignoring the Cabinet Office sign which said: \"In the interest of preserving this delicate antique, please refrain from sitting on or moving this furniture\". Well, it didn't say anything about standing, I suppose), Lady Warsi welcomed everyone to the first event of this kind.Afterwards, it was time for the monks to collect their phones and get back to their texts.

Friday's listing follows the rocky debut of luggage brand Samsonite International in Hong Kong this week \u2013 its shares slumped 8% on their first day  of trading. Around the world, volatile financial markets have been unsettled by renewed fears of a Greek sovereign debt default.\"Luxury demand is very self explanatory and it makes a lot of sense for companies like Samsonite and Prada to list in Hong Kong, but we're talking about quite a volatile market these days,\" said Selina Sia, head of consumer research at Mirae Asset in Hong Kong. \"The equity market has its own life and may not have anything to do with reality in luxury goods markets.\"Prada is yet to confirm the outcome of the share sale but the offering is said to have been over three times covered by institutional investors. The company sold 423.3m shares, or a 16.5% stake, raising HK$16.72bn (\u00a31.3bn). The stock will start trading on 24 June.Retail investors, who typically play a big part in Hong Kong IPOs, were less enthusiastic after Prada's prospectus warned that shareholders would have to pay Italian capital gains tax of 12.5% on any profits from selling their shares as well as up to 27% on dividends. That is an unusual situation in Hong Kong, which does not tax capital gains or dividends.Mario Prada started the company selling leather bags, trunks and silverware to the European elite from his store in Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in 1913 but it is his granddaughter Miuccia Prada and her husband Patrizio Bertelli who have turned it into a bona fide luxury label with more than 300 stores around the world.The decision to list in Hong Kong was deemed controversial in Italy, but the company said it made sense given China's relevance as a major economy and its voracious appetite for luxury products. China's consumption of luxury goods is growing at nearly 20% a year, with the market expected to be worth \u00a317bn by 2015.IPOsRetail industryChinaStock marketsFashionZoe Woodguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/17/prada-cuts-share-flotation-price", "title": "Prada cuts share flotation price", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 11:23:46"}}, {"pk": 401, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Filtering at Hexham library blocks websites including Comment is free \u2013 I want to find out the extent of such access restrictionsComment is free, but in some places it is in chains; dictatorial regimes have a habit of blocking particular posts, as in the case of China. And then there is Hexham public library.Try to access these and other Comment is free musings from the pleasant market town in Northumberland and you will get a message showing a red circle, as in No Cycling or No Dog Mess, and a message saying: \"Stop. You cannot access this site. The site you requested is blocked under the following categories: Blogs. Wiki.\"Strange. Hexham has its own local causes of passion \u2013 the doings of the huge Egger chipboard plant or maybe some of the saucier gigs at the Queen's Hall arts centre. But it isn't ruled by a China-style politbureau at county hall in Morpeth. And Northumberland's proud role of disseminating knowledge goes back to the Lindisfarne gospels and the venerable Bede.So is Comment is free really banned? Yes it is, says the county council, and what's more that applies to all local authority public access computers from Berwick-upon-Tweed to the Newcastle and Gateshead municipal borders. Beyond these, a different regime holds sway, and all the passions and occasional wackiness, as well as the tightly argued debate on this site, are available freely.Anything to do with the internet needs exceptional verification, and the county-wide nature of the censorship comes to you only on the word of the county council. That isn't meant to be disparaging, but it is clear from discussing the issue with county hall that exactly what is available and what isn't is not always clear even to those in charge, and so is almost certain to be inconsistent.The frustrated Hexhamite who got in touch with the Guardian reels off evidence of this. No Comment is free, but he can get our Northerner and Dave Hill's London blog. No access to naughty Guido Fawkes, but Will Straw's Left Foot Forward blog slips through. WordPress sites appear to be banned in toto, which means that the poor chap can't email off an entry to a local cycling event.To begin with, Northumberland responded thus: \"We do use secure filters on PCs that are used by staff as well as those available to members of the public in our libraries.\" In conversation, however, we looked at Comment is free together and it became obvious that the site was fully available in-house to staff.The council then said: \"We have checked this out and while we can't say what specific sites might be blocked, access is filtered based on certain types of content and certain terms, and this might exclude access to some forums, bulletin boards or similar sites such as blogs. We can access Comment is free from PCs within the council so we would need to know which public access computer is being referred to check out this individual case.\"So we zeroed in on Hexham, indeed on computer number 10 in the town library, but just as quickly zeroed out again, to embrace all public access computers. Because the final statement from Morpeth repeated the bit about the principles of access-filtering and then said: \"You are right that Comment is free is not accessible [meaning on council computers used by the public] and this is because it is a forum.\"There was also a ray of hope. Although the current policy, including a complete ban on Facebook, Twitter and streaming sites such as YouTube, follows a corporate decision endorsed by the council's library services audit, there is unease. Last word from Northumberland: \"We do know that access to knowledge through technology is important to our customers and are reviewing this as part of our overall review of library services.\"Which is good, because official guidance from the Museums and Libraries Association, the nearest thing to national best practice on library internet access, says of blocking and filtering: \"Libraries should make this known to users and provide the opportunity for them to challenge particular instances of blocking or request the adjustment of blocking criteria. And they should recognise that such techniques are imprecise and aim to minimise restrictions and avoid inadvertent blocking of legitimate resources.\"The MLA also provides case studies which show, for example, how Suffolk requires users to read and agree with the council's \"acceptable internet use\" policy, and accepts that \"filtering can never be 100%  foolproof\".And it is only fair to say that Northumberland gets a pat on the back in a different part of the censorship field. When a reader complained about the county's libraries stocking graphic novels and Japanese manga material, and about the type of young men reading them in groups, the council arranged a meeting, explained its policy of encouraging access and use and even held a subsequent book event about the medium, publicising the collection.Maybe Comment is free will get the same in due course. But in the meantime, it would be interesting to use the scope of this site to get a national picture of blocking and filtering on public library computers. The briefest Google session shows frustrations over banning, particularly when social networks are being used to help local Save Our Library campaigns from the cuts.Can you try yours?

Immediately loud explosions occurred, and the whole side of the narrow street became a running stream of flame.The spectators were seized with panic, and stood wringing their hands and screaming. The drivers and mechanicians, however, preserved their sang froid and all the cars got out safely. Then people began to realise that no mischief had been done, and laughed and talked gaily until the flames were smothered with sand.[James Gordon Bennett Jr succeeded his father at the New York Herald and became an admired editor and promoter.

For any European politician it would be an unenviable post. But Venizelos, a 54-year-old constitutional law professor, wanted the job.Venizelos is possessed of an intelligence that commands almost universal respect in Greece, and his appointment, though odd at first sight, could also be a stroke of ingenuity.As a political heavyweight with a formidable grasp of economics, the telegenic former defence minister replaces Michalis Papakonstantinou, a suave operator in the corridors of power abroad but a poor communicator at home.Venizelos, by contrast, is well connected to the country's powerful media and as one of Greece's most articulate politicians is viewed as the only man who can turn around public opinion \u2013 and get Greeks to swallow the bitter pill of more austerity.\"If he can't do it, no one can,\" said Giorgos Kyrtsos, a prominent political commentator. \"Few others can present government policy or sell the measures that need to be sold as he can.\"A prolific writer with a physically imposing presence and numerous government portfolios behind him, the French-trained legal expert also has good ties to trade unions affiliated with the ruling socialist Pasok party \u2013 organisations that in the fight to modernise Greece's sclerotic economy have often arrested reform.\"The economy needs deft political management,\" says Kyrtsos. \"The finance ministry is run by a corrupt and expensive bureaucracy that is in charge of the tax collecting system and is Pasok-controlled. Venizelos will undoubtedly have more control over those mechanisms.\"Tax evasion, the failure to raise revenues, has been the main reason for the lack of progress that has been made and is precisely why Greece now needs more austerity in return for further international aid.\"But Venizelos is as cunning as he is clever, and his appointment is also a political risk \u2013 not least for the prime minister, George Papandreou, with whom he openly clashed in a contest for the Pasok party leadership in 2007.Venizelos has none of the cosmopolitan flare of the US-born premier, and though respected among academics abroad also lacks Papandreou's connections with the international community.But the politician, who was born in Thessaloniki and is married to the daughter of a wealthy Greek entrepreneur from the northern capital, has not hidden his leadership ambitions. His hopes of being prime minister will depend to a great degree on how he heads the finance ministry in Greece's greatest hour of need.

The United Kingdom is safe \u2013 at least when it comes to Northern Ireland. Whatever Alex Salmond is attempting to do in Scotland, in the north-east part of the Emerald Isle the future remains orange rather than green.The respected Northern Ireland Life and Times survey released its latest findings this week on political attitudes towards the province's constitutional status. Overall, it found a large majority, 73%, in favour of staying inside the UK.Most significantly, the poll of 1,200 Northern Irish citizens revealed that 52% of Catholics favoured the union with Britain rather than a united Ireland. In a further blow to the hopes of a united Ireland advanced by the likes of Sinn F\u00e9in, only 4% of Protestants want Irish unity. They continue to solidly favour the status quo, even if many of them do not vote in local elections.A lot has been made of the widespread apathy towards the political system in the north of Ireland. In the recent byelection in west Belfast, there was a pitiful turnout of unionist voters in the loyalist-Protestant heartland of the Shankill Road.In some boxes in Shankill polling booths, only 28 votes were cast in a constituency that is Sinn F\u00e9in-dominated. The republican party took the seat with some ease as Paul Maskey replaced the Sinn F\u00e9in president, Gerry Adams, as the MP for the area.This apathy should not lull republicans and nationalists into the illusion that the \"Prods\" have given up. For when it comes to the existential question of the state, unionists will always vote to keep themselves unionists.Adams has moved south of the border and represents the Louth constituency in the Dail. His party more than doubled its seats in the Irish parliament, and has used its new prominence to launch yet another campaign for Irish unification.The fact, however, that Sinn F\u00e9in has started a fresh attempt to put a united Ireland top of the agenda as the results of the Life and Times survey emerge is apposite. The survey highlights a paradox facing the party. While it enjoys robust support and a growing presence in the two Irish parliaments, its basic goal is further away from being achieved than ever before.Yes, there is widespread support for the power-sharing settlement in the north. Yes, there is renewed influence for Sinn F\u00e9in in Dublin after several years of seat losses and setbacks.And yes, despite negative publicity over Adams (and other Sinn F\u00e9in figures') alleged IRA past \u2013 a past he denies but which other IRA veterans confirm \u2013 there is some admiration for the way he steered the republican movement out of the cul de sac of the armed struggle.Yet behind the rhetoric and rally cries, the reality is that, for the foreseeable future, there will be no united Ireland. Given the stark economic challenges facing a near-bankrupt Republic, unity is a far-off prospect.The implication for the UK is clear: while the micro-picture of devolved government indicates rising support for nationalist parties (particularly those opposed to the Con-Dem government's austerity programme), the macro-picture indicates that the United Kingdom may not be in such jeopardy as some commentators and anti-unionists imagine.Of course, nothing is fixed in politics. Attitudes towards the UK may change with generational shifts, although the 4% figure for pro-united Ireland Protestants is very telling.Because even if the Life and Times Survey was 10 percentage points out and there was just a 50% plus pro-Irish unity majority among Catholics, overall the pro-union vote would still be higher.Food for thought for those in Scotland and Wales who are opposed to any moves to break the British connection.Northern Irish politicsSinn F\u00e9inEuropeGerry AdamsNorthern IrelandIrelandRepublicanismMonarchyHenry McDonaldguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jun/17/life-and-times-survey-united-ireland", "title": "The Kingdom will remain United \u2013 in Ireland, at least", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 10:46:38"}}, {"pk": 408, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Businessman Hussein Salem is wanted in Egypt to face trial on charges of bribing Mubarak and squandering public fundsSpanish authorities have detained a close associate of the ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian officials have said.Hussein Salem, one of the most secretive businessmen in Egypt, was detained at his home in Mallorca on an international arrest warrant issued by Interpol. He is wanted for trial in Egypt on charges of bribing Mubarak and his family and squandering public funds.The head of Egypt's Interpol office, Brigadier General Magdy el-Shafei, told the state's Middle East News Agency that authorities were preparing the necessary documents to bring Salem back to Egypt.Salem's detention was seen as a major step towards unravelling secrets of corruption throughout the reign of Mubarak, and possibly a key to locating and retrieving much of the Mubarak family's riches, believed to be stashed abroad at a time when the country's economy is depressed. Some estimate Mubarak's holdings at tens of billions of dollars.\"Salem is not just a suspect in a corruption trial or for abuse of power. He is the bag of secrets and is the face of all the illicit and illegal activities of Mubarak and his two sons,\" said Abdel-Khaleq Farouk, an independent economist who specialises in corruption issues.Salem left Egypt a week before Mubarak was forced to resign on 11 February after 18 days of protests. After Mubarak's ousting the protesters continued to press for his prosecution and that of his cronies for alleged years of abuse and corruption.Salem was charged last month along with Mubarak and the ex-president's two sons. Their trial is scheduled for 3 August.Salem, 77, is said to have won lucrative land and other deals, including exporting gas to Israel, because of his connections to Mubarak. The natural gas deal has come under severe public criticism.Salem, an ex-army and intelligence officer, was a close associate of Mubarak from his early days in office three decades ago.Salem's name was linked to some of the early developments in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, including supplying the resort with fresh water and establishing the first hotels. In his later years Mubarak spent much of his time in his home built by Salem at the resort. He headed there after he stepped down. Mubarak is being detained now at a Sharm el-Sheikh hospital.In its charges against Salem the Egyptian prosecution said he gave Mubarak and his family real estate in Sharm el-Sheikh worth nearly $7m (\u00a34m) for less than their actual value. Mubarak is accused of enabling Salem to gain $2bn from the gas exporting deal to Israel.A day before leaving Egypt, Salem appeared on a private TV station \u2013 one of the rare times he spoke to the media \u2013 to deny he would flee.\"There is nothing to cause me to run away. For 40 years, I never worked in politics and never had a government job,\" Salem said. \"I can't put my hotels and my pumping station on my shoulder and run.\" Salem said his relationship with Mubarak was one of \"respect\".Nasser Amin, a lawyer, said Salem's close relations with Mubarak helped him operate under the radar for years.\"He is the richest businessman in Egypt.

He was speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to reporters.The new al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was sentenced in the same case along with more than 100 others, most of them in absentia.

He is fighting extradition to Sweden where he is alleged to have committed sexual offences, which he denies.Has anyone ever in Britain facing such charges been held in similar circumstances?  His passport has been confiscated, he is tagged, he must sign in at a police station once a day, and all his movements are monitored.Is all this really necessary, or even fair? Isn't this more about WikiLeaks than about an extradition case? And how much is it costing? One truly hilarious moment comes when two staff from Serco - a \"government services company\" (aka security monitoring outfit) - arrive to check the boxes linked to Assange's tag.

According to Greenpeace, the crew of the rig tried to prevent them from boarding with water cannons.The three activists are said to be 30m above sea level on a small platform. The Danish navy has launched a helicopter which arrived at the rig within the last few minutes.In addition to the likelihood of prison, Greenpeace faces a fine of $50,000 a day after Scottish oil company Cairn Energy obtained an injunction which forbade the organisation from going within 500m of the rig. Cairn sought the injunction in Holland after 20 Greenpeace activists were arrested on the rig in the last month for stopping the rig from operating.Before scaling the rig, Naidoo said he was calling on the rig's owner to halt drilling, and would request a copy of the rig's oil spill response plan. The document, which has not been made public,  has been at the centre of a month-long campaign of direct action in the Arctic.Naidoo said: \"For me this is one of the defining environmental battles of our age, it's a fight for sanity against the madness of a mindset that sees the melting of the Arctic sea ice as a good thing. As the ice retreats the oil companies want to send the rigs in and drill for the fossil fuels that got us into this mess in the first place. We have to stop them. It goes right to the heart of the kind of world we want and the one which we want to pass onto our children.\"Naidoo, 45, was a youth leader in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, where he was arrested several times and charged with violating provisions against mass mobilisation, civil disobedience and for violating the state of emergency. He lived underground before being forced to flee South Africa and live in exile in the UK.Kumi NaidooGreenpeaceActivismOilEnergyFossil fuelsOil spillsOilGreenlandPolar regionsArcticCairn EnergyJohn Vidalguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jun/17/kumi-naidoo-greenpeace-arctic-oil-rig", "title": "Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo risks arrest in Arctic oil rig protest", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 11:06:54"}}, {"pk": 411, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Photographs from the Guardian Eyewitness series\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/picture/2011/jun/17/eyewitness-guardian-london-2012", "title": "Eyewitness: On track for 2012", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 10:26:27"}}, {"pk": 412, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "National Cyber Range intended as replica of internet allowing US scientists to test defences against hackersThe US defence agency that invented the forerunner to the internet is working on a \"virtual firing range\" intended as a replica of the real internet so scientists can mimic international cyberwars to test their defences.Called the National Cyber Range, the system will be ready by next year and will also help the Pentagon to train its own hackers and refine their skills to guard US information systems, both military and domestic.The move marks another rise in the temperature of the online battlefield. The US and Israel are believed to have collaborated on a sophisticated piece of malware called Stuxnet that targeted computers controlling Iran's nuclear centrifuge scheme. Government-authorised hackers in China, meanwhile, are suspected to have been behind a number of attacks on organisations including the International Monetary Fund, French government and Google.The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), which developed Arpanet, the forerunner of the internet, in the 1960s, is working on a number of fronts to boost the US's defences against computer-generated attacks. Barack Obama has asked Congress for more than $250m (\u00a3154m) to fund Darpa's cyber initiatives in the coming year, double his fiscal 2011 request.The National Cyber Range is expected to be working by mid 2012, four years after the Pentagon approached contractors to build it at an estimated $130m.One of these companies is Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon's No 1 supplier by sales \u2013 and itself the target of what it called \"a significant and tenacious\" cyber-attack in May.Lockheed, the US government's top information technology provider, was awarded a $30.8m contract in January 2010 to continue to develop a prototype. Johns Hopkins University's applied physics laboratory won a similar deal at that time.Darpa will this summer select one of them to operate a prototype test range during a year-long test.It will also help train cyberwarriors such as those in the American military's Cyber Command, ordered up by the secretary of defence, Robert Gates, in June 2009 after he concluded the threat of digital warfare had outgrown the country's existing defences.The \"firing range\" actually will be a collection of \"testbeds\" that can carry out independent drills or be woven into one or more larger pieces, depending on the challenge. The range is to test such things as new network protocols, as well as satellite and radio frequency communications. A key goal is to run classified and unclassified experiments in quick succession \"in days rather than the weeks it currently takes,\" said Eric Mazzacone, a Darpa spokesman.That would require a system capable of being completely reset after an experiment, in which it can be reconfigured and all data purged from related memory, hard drives and storage devices. That ability to reboot and start over is central to the plan, keeping the facility available \"at all times for both experimentation and training,\" without fear of corruption or compromise, Mazzacone said.Darpa is also working on other plans to advance the US's cyber defences. A program known as Crash \u2013 for Clean-slate design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts \u2013 seeks to design computer systems that evolve over time, making them harder for an attacker to target.The Cyber Insider Threat program, or Cinder, would help monitor military networks for threats from within by improving detection of threatening behaviour from people authorised to use them. The problem has loomed large since Bradley Manning allegedly passed confidential state department documents to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website.Another is a Cyber Genome, aimed at automating the discovery, identification and characterisation of malicious code. That could help figure out who was behind a cyber-strike.The US defence department, meanwhile, is preparing an expanded pilot programme to boost the sharing of cybersecurity information with the companies that provide it with arms, supplies and other services costing some $400bn a year. The new effort, like a predecessor that began in 2007, is voluntary and is aimed at protecting sensitive but unclassified information on or passing through computers owned by companies that make up what the Pentagon calls the \"defence industrial base\", or DIB.About 35 companies took part in the initial programme, including Lockheed Martin, which said last month its computer networks had become \"a frequent target of adversaries around the world\".The expanded \"DIB Opt-In\" program will be open to many more companies. It is \"vital to the nation's military readiness and the government's overall efforts to enhance cybersecurity,\" air force lieutenant-colonel April Cunningham, a defence department spokeswoman, said in a statement to Reuters.Ultimately, the new programme may be a step towards putting major Pentagon contractors behind military-grade network perimeter defences, like those that protect the Pentagon's own classified networks.HackingMalwareData and computer securityUS national securityUnited StatesCharles Arthurguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/17/pentagon-virtual-firing-range", "title": "Cyberwar heats up with Pentagon's virtual firing range", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 11:06:37"}}, {"pk": 413, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Life and Times survey shows 73% of Northern Ireland respondents want to stay in UK rather than link up with DublinSinn F\u00e9in's campaign for a united Ireland was dealt a severe blow on Friday when a survey in Northern Ireland showed that most Catholics there preferred to remain within the UK.Fifty two per cent of Catholics living in Northern Ireland wanted that union to continue, while 35% said they desired a united Ireland.Overall, 73% of respondents to the Life and Times survey \u2013 one of the main polling bodies in the province \u2013 said they wished to stay in the UK rather than link up with Dublin.Although both Sinn F\u00e9in and the smaller nationalist SDLP party questioned the accuracy of the poll, the Life and Times survey was commissioned by the office of the first and deputy first minister at Stormont, jointly headed by Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson.In successive Life and Times surveys since 2008, a majority of Catholics taking part have indicated a preference for staying in the UK.

In contrast, Hammarberg praised the work of the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, the Guatemalan lawyer Frank La Rue, who earlier this month warned that fearful governments were increasingly restricting the free flow of information online.\"The time has come for politics to pay attention to internet media,\" Hammarberg insisted. \"These kind of clampdowns which we have seen in China must be prevented.\"We would like to see a discussion about international regulation which would filter out porn or incitement to war and hatred.

There's a need for an international dimension. Most of the sites are run by private companies but the regulations are directed towards governments. It's complicated.\"Of the use of superinjunctions in the UK courts, Hammarberg, who has been a Swedish diplomat and was formerly secretary general of Amnesty International, observed: \"That means you are not allowed to say there's even been a case about this and I believe that's a violation of expression.\"He welcomed the UK justice secretary's determination to reform the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. \"Ken Clarke really knows the European system well,\" Hammarberg said. \"I think it could be a great contribution. There are some problems of function of the court. There are 50,000 applications a year and it's overloaded. There's a need for further really radical reforms. He could help with that.\"I hope the UK authorities would go into this [positively] and not try to tear it down.

He replaces George Papaconstantinou, who was widely expected to relinquish the finance brief as the Greek economy teeters on the edge of collapse.The move, though, could not prevent world stock markets falling again as the crisis dominated the financial sector.The reshuffle is Papandreou's latest bid to try to push through tough austerity measures which says are essential to prevent Greece defaulting on its debts, but which have aroused fury among the Greek population. It was announced ahead of showdown talks between German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy over a new rescue package.Venizelos, 54, was defeated by Papandreou in a leadership election in 2007. Analysts said that his appointment improved Papandreou's chances of holding his government together.\"Venizelos is politically powerful and that might bode well for the implementation of fiscal consolidation,\" Alexander Kyrtsis of UBS told Reuters.Papaconstantinou, who becomes environment minister, has paid the price for devising the programme of tax rises and spending cutbacks which Greece agreed as the price for its first rescue package. He had become increasingly unpopular with both the Greek people and his own party.China also weighed into the ongoing Greek crisis on Friday. Vice foreign minister Fu Ying warned that China's \"vital\" interests will suffer unless Europe can find a solution to the ongoing debt crisis.With Greek bond yields at record levels, the country needs a fresh rescue package as it appears impossible that it could borrow from the financial markets next year \u2013 as was originally planned in its first bailout package, agreed last year.On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund attempted to break the deadlock by forcing Germany to drop its insistence that private creditors should accept some losses, in return for a new aid package.Greece is now expected to receive the next tranche of its original bailout package, worth \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.5bn), but the country must still drive through the hugely unpopular cutbacks.The reshuffle received an encouraging response on the Athens stock market, where Greek bank shares rose by 4% in early trading. But Greek debt remained at near-record lows, indicating that the country could not borrow from international investors. The yield, or interest rate, on a two-year Greek bond was 30.4% on Friday morning.World stock markets suffered further losses, with the FTSE 100 losing 48 points, or 0.8%, to 5650 in early trading.European debt crisisEuropeGreeceEuropeGraeme Weardenguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jun/17/greek-pm-appoints-new-finance-minister", "title": "Greek PM appoints new finance minister", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 08:48:03"}}, {"pk": 416, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Couple whose photo has been shared around the world may not have been in a passionate embrace, say witnessesThe image of the couple lying in the street seemingly locked in a kiss as the Vancouver hockey riots erupted around them has become an internet sensation, but the pair may not have been in the throes of a passionate embrace after all.After the photo was tweeted and carried on news sites around the world, people have come forward to offer a less romantic explanation of the image, taken by the Canada-based photojournalist Richard Lam.William, a witness, told the Vancouver Sun the couple were run over by two riot police officers: \"The girl who was knocked over landed head first on the pavement with her boyfriend landed partially on top of her,\" he said. \"She was in visible pain, crying, but the two officers gave them a parting shove and moved on. Bystanders went to make sure she was OK.\"Another angle of the photo, which the Vancouver Sun reports was sent in by several readers, appears to support William's version of events.Meanwhile, a woman has contacted the Australian website 9News to claim  she is the sister of the man in the photograph, whom she names as 29-year-old Scott Jones, from Perth. Hannah Jones said Scott had been living and working in Vancouver for six months.She told 9news that lots of his friends had left messages on his Facebook page and he had posted a reply saying: \"Classic! This was shortly after the riot police run over the top of us and naturally Alex needed some comforting.\"Lam took the photograph while covering the riots that followed the Vancouver Canucks' 4-0 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup.The photographer was being buffeted by rioters and riot police when he spotted the couple. \"I was about 20 or 30 yards away,\" he said. \"There were these two people on the ground in this empty street. Initially I thought one of them was hurt.\" He took a few shots and then the moment was lost.\"It was complete chaos. Rioters set two cars on fire and then I saw looters break the window at a neighbouring department store,\" he said.\"At that point, the riot police charged right towards us. After I stopped running, I noticed in the space behind the line of police that two people were lying in the street with the riot police and a raging fire just beyond them.\"I knew I had captured a 'moment' when I snapped the still forms against the backdrop of such chaos but it wasn't until later when I returned to the rink to file my photos that my editor pointed out that the two people were not hurt, but kissing,\" Lam said before the real story behind the photo was apparently revealed.Officials in Vancouver said almost 150 people required hospital treatment and almost 100 were arrested during the riot.A spokeswoman for the local health authority said three stabbing victims had been admitted and one man was in a critical condition with head injuries after a fall from a viaduct.Rioting and looting left cars burned, stores in shambles and windows shattered over a roughly 10-block radius of the city's main shopping district.The police chief, Jim Chu, said nine officers were injured, including one who required 14 stitches after being hit with a thrown brick. Chu said some officers suffered bite marks. He said 15 cars were burned, including two police cars.He called those who incited the riot \"criminals and anarchists\" and said officers identified some in the crowd as the same people who smashed windows and caused trouble through the same streets the day after the 2010 Winter Olympics opened.\"These were people who came equipped with masks, goggles and gasoline,\" he said. \"They had a plan.\"Chu said those who stood by and filmed and cheered also bore  responsibility.The assistant fire chief, Wade Pierlot, said people were rescued from rooftops and bathrooms where they had hidden for safety. He said some people moved burning dumpsters away from buildings to prevent further damage.CanadaPhotographyDominic RusheHaroon Siddiqueguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News & Media Limited 2011 | Use of this content is subject to our Terms & Conditions | More Feeds\n\n", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/17/vancouver-kiss-couple-riot-police", "title": "Vancouver kiss couple 'were knocked down by riot police'", "source": 15, "date": "2011-06-17 10:15:01"}}, {"pk": 417, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Secretary of Education Arne Duncan says students must be allowed to form gay-friendly clubs.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/high-school-notes/2011/6/17/duncan-says-discriminating-against-lgbt-clubs-violates-law.html?s_cid=rss:high-school-notes:duncan-says-discriminating-against-lgbt-clubs-violates-law", "title": "Duncan Says Discriminating Against LGBT Clubs Violates Law", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-17 12:00:00"}}, {"pk": 418, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Sexting congressman last in internet support behind even BP chairman.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2011/6/16/weiner-had-worse-web-buzz-than-other-scandal-figures.html?s_cid=rss:washington-whispers:weiner-had-worse-web-buzz-than-other-scandal-figures", "title": "Weiner Had Worse Web Buzz Than Other Scandal Figures", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 20:56:00"}}, {"pk": 419, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Former Utah governor doesn't want to play 'traffic cop' in Afghanistan.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2011/6/16/republican-president-hopefuls-going-dovish-on-afghanistan.html?s_cid=rss:republican-president-hopefuls-going-dovish-on-afghanistan", "title": "Republican Presidential Hopefuls Going Dovish on Afghanistan", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 20:35:00"}}, {"pk": 420, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "For Democrats, the message was too important to support N.Y. lawmaker.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2011/6/16/democrats-tired-of-weiner-distraction.html?s_cid=rss:democrats-tired-of-weiner-distraction", "title": "Democrats Tired of Weiner Distraction", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 20:06:00"}}, {"pk": 421, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Canadians don\u2019t like that \"their\" sport has been hijacked by globalization and international competition.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/susan-milligan/2011/6/16/the-deeper-meaning-behind-the-canuck-riot.html?s_cid=rss:susan-milligan:the-deeper-meaning-behind-the-canuck-riot", "title": "The Deeper Meaning Behind the Canuck Riot", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 19:25:00"}}, {"pk": 422, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Researcher Robert Walker ventured into the Amazon to investigate the status of logging in the area.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2011/6/16/deforestation-in-the-amazon-rainforest.html?s_cid=rss:deforestation-in-the-amazon-rainforest", "title": "Deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 19:00:00"}}, {"pk": 423, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "With the right card, you can pay less to fill up your tank.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/my-money/2011/6/16/how-to-save-on-gas-with-your-credit-card.html?s_cid=rss:my-money:how-to-save-on-gas-with-your-credit-card", "title": "How to Save on Gas with Your Credit Card", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 18:20:00"}}, {"pk": 424, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "Low-income program faces cuts as major senior groups lobby to shield Social Security and Medicare.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/the-best-life/2011/6/16/protecting-senior-benefits-puts-medicaid-at-risk.html?s_cid=rss:the-best-life:protecting-senior-benefits-puts-medicaid-at-risk", "title": "Protecting Senior Benefits Puts Medicaid at Risk", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 18:11:00"}}, {"pk": 425, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "These twenty-somethings planners stress the importance of thinking about retirement now.", "cluster": null, "url": "http://www.usnews.com/blogs/alpha-consumer/2011/6/16/how-gen-y-financial-planners-win-over-clients.html?s_cid=rss:alpha-consumer:how-gen-y-financial-planners-win-over-clients", "title": "How Gen Y Financial Planners Win Over Clients", "source": 16, "date": "2011-06-16 17:56:00"}}, {"pk": 426, "model": "news.news", "fields": {"body": "New York Democratic Rep.
